# iOS Installation with `react-native link`

**Note:** `react-native-background-geolocation-firebase` requires Cocoapods.  If you haven't yet configured your project for Cocaopods, first initialize your `Podfile`:

```shell
$ cd ios
$ pod init
```

```shell
$ npm install --save react-native-background-geolocation-firebase
$ react-native link react-native-background-geolocation-firebase
```

To open your project in XCode, use the file `YourProject.xcworkspace` (**not** `YourProject.xcodeproj`)
